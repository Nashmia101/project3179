## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive data visualization dashboard analyzing rainfall patterns and their relationship with water production, temperature, and humidity across Peninsular Malaysia from 2014 to 2020.

By integrating multiple environmental datasets, the dashboard reveals spatial differences, seasonal behavior, and climate trends that influence water availability across states, supporting deeper data-driven understanding of environmental conditions.

## Technical Implementation

The dashboard was engineered as an interactive web-based visualization using **Vega-Lite, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. Vega-Lite enabled declarative construction of the visualizations, JavaScript powered interactivity and coordinated views, while HTML and CSS provided the structural framework and interface styling for a cohesive analytical environment.

Multiple linked views were developed to support exploratory analysis, allowing users to dynamically examine spatial patterns, rainfall behavior, atmospheric conditions, and water production trends across states and years.

The dashboard features:

- A choropleth map illustrating rainfall distribution across states  
- Seasonal rainfall comparisons to highlight temporal patterns  
- A calendar heatmap revealing rainfall frequency  
- Temperature range visualizations for climate context  
- Humidity distribution analysis  
- State-level water production comparisons  
- A scatter plot examining the relationship between rainfall and water output  
- Indexed trend lines enabling cross-variable comparison over time  

Interactive filters allow flexible exploration by state and year.

## Data Preparation

Datasets were cleaned, standardized, and merged by state and year to ensure consistent cross-variable comparison. The analysis was restricted to Peninsular Malaysia (2014–2020), with missing values removed, measurement units aligned, and geographic identifiers harmonized.

## Why This Project Matters

Understanding how rainfall and climate conditions influence water production is critical for environmental monitoring, infrastructure planning, and long-term resource management. This dashboard provides a structured analytical interface for interpreting these relationships through integrated data visualization.
