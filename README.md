## What This Project Is

This project presents an interactive data visualization dashboard analyzing rainfall patterns and their relationship with water production, temperature, and humidity across Peninsular Malaysia from 2014 to 2020.

The dashboard integrates multiple environmental datasets to reveal spatial differences, seasonal behavior, and climate trends that influence water availability across states.

## What I Built

I designed and developed a multi-view analytical dashboard that enables users to explore climate and water data through interactive visualizations.

The dashboard includes:

- A choropleth map to display rainfall distribution across states  
- Seasonal rainfall comparisons to highlight temporal patterns  
- A calendar heatmap to reveal rainfall frequency  
- Temperature range visualizations for climate context  
- Humidity distribution analysis  
- State-level water production comparisons  
- A scatter plot examining the relationship between rainfall and water output  
- Indexed trend lines to support cross-variable comparison over time  

Interactive filters allow users to dynamically explore patterns by state and year.

## Data Preparation

The datasets were cleaned, standardized, and merged by state and year to ensure consistent comparison. The analysis was restricted to Peninsular Malaysia between 2014 and 2020, with missing values removed and measurement units aligned.

## Why This Project Matters

Understanding how rainfall and climate conditions affect water production is important for environmental monitoring, infrastructure planning, and long-term resource management. This dashboard provides a structured way to interpret these relationships through data.
