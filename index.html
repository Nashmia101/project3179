          The east coast gets the most rain each year.
          Terengganu is often highest, around 4–5&nbsp;mm a day.
          Perlis is usually lowest, near 1&nbsp;mm a day.
          Most other states sit between 2–3&nbsp;mm a day.
          This follows the late-year Northeast Monsoon.</p>

          <p class="lead">Rainfall patterns across months</p>
          <p class="muted">Rainfall in Peninsular Malaysia follows a clear seasonal cycle, with low rainfall from February to August and a sharp rise from October to December during the Northeast Monsoon. The east coast, especially Kelantan, Terengganu, and Pahang, receives the heaviest rain, often exceeding 10–20&nbsp;mm per day. Western states like Perlis, Penang, and Melaka stay drier, while Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, and Johor see moderate year-end increases. The monsoon remains the main driver of Malaysia’s recurring wet and dry seasons.</p>

From 2014 to 2020, most states have many dry days<br>
from February to August, then many wet days from October<br>
to December during the Northeast Monsoon. The east coast<br>
Terengganu, Pahang, and Kelantan records the most very wet<br>
days, often above 40 to 50 millimeters on several<br>
consecutive days. Western states such as Perlis, Penang,<br>
and Selangor have fewer very wet days. Johor and<br>
Negeri Sembilan show a moderate increase in wet days<br>
toward year end.

          <p class="muted" style="margin:1em 0 0">For minimum temperatures, Selangor-Wilayah, Penang, and Melaka stay warmer at night (24–25&nbsp;°C) due to drier conditions and urban heat, while Pahang is the coolest (19–22&nbsp;°C) from rain and elevation.</p>
          <p class="muted" style="margin:1em 0 0">Overall, temperatures stay steady with slightly warmer nights, showing that higher rainfall keeps states cooler.</p>

          <p class="lead">Variations in Humidity across Peninsular Malaysia</p>
          <p class="muted">From 2014 to 2020, most weather stations in Peninsular Malaysia showed very high humidity of 80&nbsp;percent or more. The share was highest in 2017 at 85&nbsp;percent and lowest in 2016 and 2019 at 59&nbsp;percent. It went up a little again in 2020 to 67&nbsp;percent.</p>
          <p class="muted" style="margin:1em 0 0">This agrees with your summary that the highlands and east coast stay very humid most of the time, while some urban and west coast stations drop slightly to the 75–80&nbsp;percent range. The data also fits the rainfall pattern since years with higher humidity usually have more wet days during the monsoon months.</p>

          <p class="muted" style="margin:1em 0 0">This pattern relates to rainfall and population, as states with steady rainfall and higher demand, like Selangor and Johor, produce more water. In contrast, states with fewer facilities and lower demand, such as Perlis and Kelantan, record lower production.</p>

          <p class="muted">The chart compares rainfall, temperature, and humidity after normalizing them with the formula (value – minimum) / (maximum – minimum) to match their scales. From 2014 to 2020, temperature and humidity often move in opposite directions. Hot, dry years like 2016 contrast with wetter, cooler years like 2020. Coastal states stay more humid, while urban areas show sharper temperature rises, showing the balance between heat and moisture.</p>
